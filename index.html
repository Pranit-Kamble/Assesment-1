    <h3>1. Difference between div and span?</h3>
    <p style="font-size:larger;">       div tag stands for division tag and it is block-level element means it is bound to take the whole width of the screen.
    span tag is an inline element means it only takes the space that is required for it. It is used for grouping inline elements in the HTML documents.
     Div should be used to wrap sections of a document, while spans should be used to wrap small portions of text, images, etc.
    </p><br>
    <h3>2. Difference between class and IDs?</h3>
    <p style="font-size:larger;">In HTML, the only difference between class and ID is that IDs are unique and each element can have only one ID. On the otherhand classes are not unique we can use same class on multiple elements.
       <br> •	IDs: Each page can have only one element with that ID. <br>
•	CLASS: You can use multiple classes on the same element.

    </p><br>
    <h3>3. What are self-closing tags?</h3>
    <p style="font-size:larger;"> In HTML, A self-closing tag is a type of tag that need not to be closed by closing tag, which means there is no separate closing tag for it as /tag.
        Elements that don't have any content are called empty elements.
        
        br is an empty element without a closing tag (the br tag defines a line break).
        Empty elements can be "closed" in the opening tag like this: br /.
        
        Example: img / ,  input / ,  br /.
    </p> <br>
    
    <h3>4. How many types of heading tags are there? How to decide which to use where?</h3>
    <p style="font-size:larger;">    Heading tags are titles or subtitles that we want to display on our webpage. There are six levels of heading tags are there in HTML.You can choose from h1 to h6 according to the size you require.
    </p><br>

    <h3>5. Difference between block and inline?</h3>
    <p style="font-size:larger;">  A block element always begins on a new line and extends to left and right, and it takes the full width available on the webpage. Browsers automatically add some space(margin) before and after element.
        Examples of block elements are div, p, h1toh6, table and form etc.
        An inline element does not begin on a new line. It only takes the space that is necessary for it.
        Examples of inline elements are a, span, img, input, label etc.

    <h3>6. Difference between em and strong?</h3>
    <p style="font-size:larger;">The strong and em tags are used for emphasizing parts of a text.
        The strong tag should be used to indicate strong importance, or urgency, like to indicate key phrases in a text for someone skimming it.
        The em tag should be used to represent stress emphasis, like when you'd read the emphasized text in a different tone of voice. Both tags can be used together, where it makes sense.
        
    </p><br>
    <h3>7. What are Attributes?</h3>
    <p style="font-size:larger;"> In HTML, Attributes are special words which provide additional information about the elements and are the modifiers of HTML element.
        Attributes should be written in lowercase only as they are case sensitive. It should always be applied with its name and value pair.
        It should always be applied with the start tag, we can add multiple attributes to an element by giving space between two attributes.
